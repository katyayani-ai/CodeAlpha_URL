The **Simple URL Shortener** is an intuitive web application that allows users to convert long URLs into concise, manageable links. Built using **Node.js** and **Express**, it provides a straightforward and efficient solution for anyone looking to share links easily. The primary interface invites users to enter their lengthy URLs into a designated input box. With a simple click of the "Shorten" button, users instantly receive a shortened version of their URL, making it convenient for sharing on various platforms.

Each shortened URL is generated using a unique six-character alphanumeric string, ensuring that every link remains distinctive and secure. This randomness not only protects against potential collisions but also enhances the usability of the application. When users click on the shortened link, they are seamlessly redirected to the original URL, providing a smooth and efficient browsing experience. 

Moreover, the application is designed to handle errors gracefully. If a user tries to access a non-existent short URL, a clear "URL not found" message is displayed. This user-friendly approach minimizes frustration and helps maintain a positive interaction with the application. The **Simple URL Shortener** combines functionality and simplicity, making it an essential tool for anyone looking to share links more efficiently and effectively.
